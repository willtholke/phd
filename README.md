# Peregrine Human Data (PHD)


*Peregrine Human Data* is your typical run-of-the-mill human data company. They manage contractors and projects, but the actual tasking data lives scattered across different platforms–sometimes taskers work on OpenAI’s Feather, Meta’s SRT Tool, or in Airtable. Peregrine brings all that data into one place so Peregrine Human Data can **finally see the complete picture**.
